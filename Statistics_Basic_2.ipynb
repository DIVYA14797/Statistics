        "* Covariance can take on any value, positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to move in the same direction, a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions, and a covariance of zero indicates no linear relationship.\n",

        "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
        "* Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean, pulling it towards their extreme values. A single outlier that is much larger or smaller than the other values can greatly distort the mean.\n",
        "* Median: Outliers have minimal effect on the median because it is not sensitive to extreme values. The median is determined by the middle value in the dataset, so outliers do not influence its calculation as long as they do not change the order of the dataset significantly.\n",
        "* Mode: Outliers may or may not affect the mode, depending on their frequency. If an outlier is unique and occurs only once, it will not affect the mode. However, if an outlier appears multiple times, it can become the mode and influence the central tendency.\n",
        "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
        "* Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range, especially if they are extreme values. The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, so outliers can increase the range substantially.\n",
        "* Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation, especially in datasets where the mean is used as the measure of central tendency. Since variance and standard deviation are based on deviations from the mean, outliers with large deviations from the mean can inflate these measures.\n",
        "* Interquartile Range (IQR): Outliers have minimal effect on the IQR because it is based on the spread of the middle 50% of the data, specifically the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Outliers do not affect Q1 and Q3 directly, so they have minimal impact on the IQR.\n",
